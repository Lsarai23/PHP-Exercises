# PHP Exercises

Hey guys!üñêÔ∏è

This is a list of PHP exercises that I've done only for training.

I've applied knowledge of:
- Basics structures in PHP
- Forms in HTML + PHP
- Numbers formats (currency, decimals, etc)
- SuperGlobals ($_GET, $_POST, $_SERVER)

Here you can find 13 exercises:
- Analysing Real Numbers: Separate a real number in decimals and integer part
- Analysing Division: Based on Euclides's division, where you see the remainder and quocient.
- 'Caixa Eletr√¥nico' = ATM: Simulates a ATM, returning the correct change
- Time calculator: Receiving a amount of time in seconds, returns how many weeks, days, hours, minutes and second it represents.
- 'Cota√ß√£o' = Quote: Converts real into dollar values.
- 'Cota√ß√£o Avan√ßada' = Advanced project of Quotes: Converts real into dollar values, based in the current quote. It's based on a brazillian API of 'Banco Central do Brasil'.
-  'Idade' = Age: Returns your present or past or future age based in the differenc of when you was born and the year passed as an argument.
-  'M√©dias' = Averages: Returns the basic average and the weighted average of some numbers.
-  Predecessor and Successor: Returns the predecessor and the successor of a number.
-  'Ra√≠zes' = radices: Calculates every radix from a number, i.e., square root, cube root, etc.
-  'Reajuste': Simulates a percentual rise in price
-  'Sal√°rio M√≠nimo' = Minimum Salary: Returns a analysis of you current salary, to see how many minimum salaries you receive. Don't worry, it doesn't have a data base, so the salaries shared to this calculator won't be stored!
-  'Sorteador' = Drawer: Generate random numbers
  
You can execute those exercises simulating a php server with Apache or using a web compiler, such as Online PHP, W3 Schools, etc.

**I hope you enjoy it!ü§ü**
